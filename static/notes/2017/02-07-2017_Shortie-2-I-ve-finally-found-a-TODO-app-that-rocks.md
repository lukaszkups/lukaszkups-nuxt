I've tried many TODO apps that are available on the market. Most of them was doing their job perfectly, but lacked of fine user interface.

Some of them has a nice interface, but at the same time was not available on linux and Windows Phone 10 platform, which I use.

At some point I was so determined to try developing my own tool, but porting it to so specific (and really different) platforms eventually exceeded my patience and time I wanted to spend on such objective.

To be more specific for my needs about desktop app: I was looking for a tool that is easy accessible during everyday work (e.g. as a icon in the main menu bar) but none of available options was a perfect fit.

Finally, I've decided to change this requirement and I've checked available browser plugins (because 50%+ of my computer time I spent inside it (the rest is vim)).

After some research, I've found it: a [Todoist](http://todoist.com).

It's a really nice tool, that can be run on any platform You want (inside browsers, desktop or on mobile).

I really like its clean, minimalistic design and straightforward flow of usage.

I'm using a Todoist free plan and can't think about any reasons to switch into paid one - basic plan have everything that meets my needs perfectly:

- adding tasks,
- categorizing tasks,
- clean design,
- real multiplatform implementation,
- nice additional feature: adding current page as a task

If You're searching for TODO app that works and looks nice - give it a try.

Or maybe You prefer other apps? I'd love to hear about them.

Best,
