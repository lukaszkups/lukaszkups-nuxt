Is there any reason to keep complaining about javascript fatigue in 2017?

tldr;

No.

## This shortie is my personal opinion about recent thread on Hacker News (available [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13849051))

Reading through it I've seen repeating comments about current javascript fatigue or how messy js as a language is.

In my opinion the developers themselves are the cause of such state.

Everyone seems frustrated that they all have to use some weird multi-level abstraction tools to deal with web front-end development.

But the truth is that they don't have to.

They don't have to use webpack and Babel.

They don't have to write code in ES6+.

They don't have to use React.js/Angular.js/Backbone.js/Ember.js.

They don't have to use CSS modules or PostCSS (or any other fancy/weird CSS-related stuff).

But they should always choose best tool for the job - and trust me - very often stuff above won't be necessary. 

5 years ago there were also rich web applications (a.k.a. today's SPAs), but they wasn't built on top of such monolith tools.

In almost every projects that I had pleasure to work with as a freelancer, there was just jQuery and couple other js plugins as a main stack. And codebase of these apps is maintanable and still clear today.

It is not a coincidence that I've decided to build [Rakun.js](http://lukaszkups.net/tags/rakunjs/) with such simple approach - when You're dealing with all those fancy tools on everyday job making such side-project feels like a relief.

Additionaly, after speaking with couple fellow front-end developers I've found a pattern, that most of those who complain most about classic approach of front-end development are unable to design proper app architecture by themselves - they need clear frames **HOW-TO** build something - which is very often provided by X or Y framework guides.

So don't be harsh to yourself - if You don't want to work with React/Webpack/Babel/shinyFancyHypedFrameworkOrToolNameHere - just don't use it.

BTW. Today goes straight month since my last blog post. I was pretty overworked with some extra projects so I didn't manage to create any new content. But in upcoming days I plan to push further development of [Rakun.js](http://lukaszkups.net/tags/rakunjs/) and finally use it in personal [side-project](http://lukaszkups.net/projects/) - stay focused!

Best,
