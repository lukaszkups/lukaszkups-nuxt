Today I've learned about [the boring stack](http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/happiness-is-a-boring-stack.html).

*tl;dr It's the way of making things, using not exactly latest (hyped) tools, but those which actually works best for You.*

So I can call myself a **boring stack javascript developer** - which means that I can ship clean, maintanable code that implements Your business goals, but I don't have in my CV the shiny, latest frameworks which Your company is looking for (only because other companies also do it).

Challenge of the Year 2017 - find a company that is looking for boring stack javascript developer.

Seriously, I dare You.

Best,
