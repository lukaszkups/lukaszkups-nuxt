Welcome to my new (temporary) blog! Finally I've managed to setup new version of it (old one is available at [github](https://github.com/lukaszkups/lukaszkups-old/tree/master/content/blog))

This year was a very productive for me. I've managed to start working on my new, minimal and oldschool-like framework [Rakun.js](https://github.com/lukaszkups/rakun.js) and my very own static site generator with web interface, [Inku.js](https://github.com/lukaszkups/inku). 

While Rakun.js is already used in production (mobile app), Inku is still in very early alpha (I've decided to completely change main app template and use Rakun.js as a base for the frontend part).

## New Year's Resolutions - 2016/2017 edition

The biggest problem with New Year's Resolutions is that we're unable to keep with them / finish.

In one of the last posts at my previous blog I've put some New Year's Resolutions for the upcoming year - most of them was blog-related which I've never done (till now).

I've decided to change that.

After almost whole year without blogging I've collected many topics to save for myself/share with community. 

I've decided to setup a quick, temporary version of new blog, based on [Hexo static site generator](http://hexo.io). I'll publish my new content here, till I've finish my Inku.js CMS - then I'll migrate everything from here and my old blog to a new one.

The theme I've used is a [Cactus theme dark](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark) by Pieter Robberechts with couple modifications - this guy did amazing job and You should definitely give couple stars to his github repos.

In the meantime - going back to code ;)

Best,
